            "Ever since the dawn of human life on this planet, Man has always tried to understand Nature, his own place in the scheme of Creation and the purpose of Life itself. In this quest for Truth, spanning many centuries and diverse civilizations, organized religion has shaped human life and, to a large extent, has determined the cour se of history. While some religions have been based on written text, claimed by their followers to be divinely inspired, others have relied solely on human experience.\n" +
                    "Al-Qur’an, the main source of  the Islamic faith, is  a book believed by its follower s, the Muslims, to be completely of Divine origin. Muslims also believe that it contains guidance for all humankind. Since the message of the Qur’an is believed to be for all times, it should be relevant to every age. But does the Qur’an pass this test?\n" +
                    "In this booklet, I intend to give an objective analysis of the Muslim belief regarding the Divine origin of the Qur’an, particularly in the light of established scientific discoveries.\n" +
                    "There was a time, in the history of world civilization, when ‘miracles’, or what were perceived to be miracles, took precedence over human reason and logic. Of cour se, the normal defination of ‘miracle’ is simply, anything that takes place out of the normal\n" +
                    "course of life and for which humankind has no explanation.\n" +
                    "However, we must be careful before accepting something as a miracle. In 1993, ‘The Times of India’, Mumbai, reported that ‘a saint’ by the name ‘Baba Pilot’ claimed to have stayed continuously submerged under water in  a tank for three consecutive days and nights. However, when reporters wanted to examine the bottom of the tank  of water in which he claimed to have performed his ‘miraculous feat’, he refused to let them do so. He argued by asking as to how one could examine the womb of a mother that gives birth to a child. Obviously the ‘saint’ had something to conceal! His claim was a gimmick simply to gain publicity.\n" +
                    "Surely, no modern person with even the slightest inkling towards rational thinking would accept  such a ‘miracle’. If such false miracles are the tests of divinity, then we would have to accept all world famous magicians known for their ingenious magical tricks and illusions, as genuine God-men!\n" +
                    "A book, claiming to be of Divine origin, is in effect, claiming to be a miracle. Such a claim should be easily verifiable in any age, according to the standards of that age. Muslims believe, that the Qur’an is the last and final revelation of God, the miracle of miracles, revealed as a mercy to mankind. Let us therefore investigate the veracity of this belief.\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "THE CHALLENGE OF THE QUR’AN\n" +
                    "Literature and poetry have been instruments of human expression and creativity, in all cultures. The world also witnessed an age when li terature and poetry occupied pride of position, similar to that now enjoyed by science and technology.\n" +
                    "Even non-Muslim scholars agree that the Qur’an is Arabic literature par excellence – that it is the best Arabic literature on the face of the earth. The Qur’an challenges mankind to produce the likes of it:\n" +
                    "وَإِنْ كُنْتُمْ فِي رَيْبٍ مِمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا بِسُورَةٍ مِنْ مِثْلِهِ وَادْعُوا شُهَدَاءَكُمْ مِنْ دُونِ اللَّهِ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ صَادِقِينَ\n" +
                    "\" And if you are in doubt as to what we have revealed from time to time to Our servant, then produce a Surah like thereunto; And call your witnesses or helpers (if there are any) besides Allah, if your (doubts) are true. But if you cannot and of a surety you cannot then fear the Fire whose fuel is Men and Stones which is prepared for those who reject faith\" [ 2:23-24 ]\n" +
                    "The challenge of the Qur’an, is to produce a single Surah (chapter) like the Surahs it contains. The same challenge is repeated in the Qur’an  several  times. The challenge to produce a Surah , which, in beauty, eloquence, depth and meaning is at least somewhat similar to a Qur’anic Surah remains unmet to this day.\n" +
                    "A modern rational man, however, would  never  accept a religious scripture which says, in the best possible poetic language, that the world is flat. This is because we live in an age, where human reason, logic and science are given primacy. Not many would accept the Qur’an’s extraordinarily beautiful language, as proof of its Divine origin. Any scripture claiming to be a divine revelation must also be acceptable on the strength of its own reason and logic.\n" +
                    "According to the famous physicist and Nobel Prize winner, Albert Einstein, “Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.” Let us therefore study the Qur’an, and analyze whether the Qur’an and Modern Science are compatible or incompatible?\n" +
                    "The Qur’an is not a book of Science but a book of ‘Signs’, i.e. Aayaats . There are more than six thousand ‘Signs’ in the Qur’an of which more than a thousand deal with hard core S cience.\n" +
                    "We all know that many a times Science takes a ‘U-turn’. In this book I have considered only established scientific facts and not hypotheses and theories based on mere assumptions and not backed by proof.\n",

            "CREATION OF THE UNIVERSE: ‘THE BIG BANG’\n" +
                    "The creation of the universe is explained by astrophysicists as a widely accepted phenomenon, popularly known as ‘The Big Bang’. It is supported by observational and experimental data gathered by astronomers\tand\tastrophysicists  for\tdecades. According to ‘The Big Bang’, the whole universe was initially one big mass (Primary Nebula). Then there was a ‘Big Bang’ (Secondary Separation) which resulted in the formation of Galaxies. These then divided to form stars, planets, the sun, the moon, etc. The origin of the universe was unique and the probability of it happening by ‘chance’ is nil.\n" +
                    "The Qur’an contains the following verse regarding the origin of the universe:\n" +
                    "أَوَلَمْ يَرَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا أَنَّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ كَانَتَا رَتْقًا فَفَتَقْنَاهُمَا ۖ\n" +
                    "\" Do not the unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of Creation), before we clove them asunder\" [ 21:30 ] \n" +
                    "The striking similarity between the Qur’anic verse and ‘The Big Bang’ is inescapable! How could a book, which first appeared in the deserts of Arabia 1400 years ago, contain this profoun d scientific truth?\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "INITIAL GASEOUS MASS BEFORE CREATION OF GALAXIES\n" +
                    "Scientists agree that before the galaxies in the universe were formed, celestial matter was initially in the form of gaseous matter. In short, huge gaseous matter or clouds were present before the formation of the galaxies. To describe initial celestial matter, the word ‘smoke’ is more appropriate than gas. The following Qur’anic verse refers to this state of the universe by the word dukhaan which means smoke.\n" +
                    "ثُمَّ اسْتَوَىٰ إِلَى السَّمَاءِ وَهِيَ دُخَانٌ فَقَالَ لَهَا وَلِلْأَرْضِ ائْتِيَا طَوْعًا أَوْ كَرْهًا قَالَتَا أَتَيْنَا طَائِعِينَ\n" +
                    "\" Moreover, He Comprehended in His design the sky, and it had been (as) smoke: He said to it and to the eartj: Come ye togehter, willingly or unwillingly. They said: we do come (together) in willing obedience\" [ 41:11 ]\n" +
                    "Again, this fact is a corollary to the ‘Big Bang’ and was not known to anyone before the prophetehood of Muhammad (Peace be upon him) 1. What then, could have been the source of this knowledge?\n" +
                    "SHAPE OF THE EARTH IS SPHERICAL\n" +
                    "In early times, people believed that the earth was flat. For centuries, men were afraid to venture out too far, for fear of falling off the edge! Sir Francis Drake was the fir s t person who proved that the earth is spherical when he sailed around it in 1597.\n" +
                    "Consider the following Qur’anic verse regarding the alternation of day and night:\n" +
                    "أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُولِجُ اللَّيْلَ فِي النَّهَارِ وَيُولِجُ النَّهَارَ فِي اللَّيْلِ\n" +
                    "\" Seest thou not that Allahh merges Night into Day and He merges Day to Night ?\" [ 32:29 ]\n" +
                    "Merging here means that the night slowly and gradually changes to day and vice versa. This phenomenon can only take place if the earth is spherical. If the earth was flat, there would have been a sudden change from night to day and from day to night.\n" +
                    "The following verse also alludes to the spherical shape of the earth:\n" +
                    "خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ بِالْحَقِّ ۖ يُكَوِّرُ اللَّيْلَ عَلَى النَّهَارِ وَيُكَوِّرُ النَّهَارَ عَلَى اللَّيْلِ\n" +
                    "\"He created the heavens and the earth in true (prepositions): He makes the Night overlap the Day, and the Day overlap the Night\" [ 39:5 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word used here is Kawwara meaning ‘to overlap’ or ‘to coil’– the way a turban is wound around the head. The overlapping or coiling of the day and night can only take place if the earth is spherical.\n" +
                    "The earth is not exactly round like a ball, but geo-spherical, i.e. i t is flattened at the poles. The following verse contain s a description of the earth’s shape:\n" +
                    "وَالْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ دَحَاهَا\n" +
                    "\"And the Earth, moreover hath He made eggshaped\" [ 79:30 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word for egg here is dahaahaa 1 which means an ostrich-egg. The shape of an ostrich-egg resembles the geo-sp herical shape of the earth.\n" +
                    "Thus the Qur’an correctly describes the shape of the earth, though the prevalent notion when the Qur’an was revealed was that the earth was flat.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "MOONLIGHT IS REFLECTED LIGHT\n" +
                    "It was believed by earlier civilizations that the moon emanates its own light. Science now tells us that the light of the moon is reflected light. However this fact was mentioned in the Qur’an 1,400 years ago in the following verse:\n" +
                    "تَبَارَكَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ فِي السَّمَاءِ بُرُوجًا وَجَعَلَ فِيهَا سِرَاجًا وَقَمَرًا مُنِيرًا\n" +
                    "\" Blessed is He Who made Constellations in the skies, and placed therein a Lamp and a Moon giving Light\" [ 25:61 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word for the sun in the Qur’an, is shams. It is also referred to as siraaj which means a ‘torch’ or as wahhaaj meaning ‘a blazing lamp’ or as diya which means ‘shining glory’. All three descriptions are appropriate to the sun, since i t generates intense heat and light by its internal combustion. The Arabic word for the  moon  is  qam ar  and  i t is described in the Qur’an as m uneer which is a body that gives noor i.e. reflected light. Again, the Qur’anic description matches perfectly with the true nature of the moon which does not give off light by itself and is an inactive body that  reflects  the light of the sun. Not once in the Qur’an, is the moon mentioned as siraaj, wahhaaj or diya nor the sun as noor or m uneer . This implies that the Qur’an recognizes the difference between the nature of sunlight and moonlight.\n" +
                    "The following verses relate to the nature of light from the sun and the moon:\n" +
                    "هُوَ الَّذِي جَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ ضِيَاءً وَالْقَمَرَ نُورًا\n" +
                    "\" It is He who made the sun to be a shining glory and the moon to be a light (of beauty)\" [ 10:5 ]\n" +
                    "أَلَمْ تَرَوْا كَيْفَ خَلَقَ اللَّهُ سَبْعَ سَمَاوَاتٍ طِبَاقًا; وَجَعَلَ الْقَمَرَ فِيهِنَّ نُورًا وَجَعَلَ الشَّمْسَ سِرَاجًا\n" +
                    "\" See ye not how Allah has created the seven heavens one above another; And made the moon a light in their midst, and made the sun as a (Gloroius) Lamp?\" [ 71:15-16 ]\n" +
                    "The Glorious Qur'an and modern science, are thus in perfect agreement about the differences in the nature of sunlight and moonlight.\n" +
                    "THE SUN ROTATES\n" +
                    "For a long time European philosophers and scientists believed that the earth stood still in the centre of the universe and every other body including the sun moved around it. In the West, this geocentric concept of the universe was prevalent right from the time of Ptolemy in the second century B.C. In 1512, Nicholas Copernicus put forward his Heliocentric Theory of Planetary Motion, which asserted that the sun is\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "motionless at the centre of the solar system with the planets revolving around it.\n" +
                    "In 1609, the German scientist Yohannus Keppler published the ‘ Astronomia Nova ’. In this he concluded that not only do the planets move in elliptical orbits around the sun, they also rotate upon their axes at irregular speeds. With this knowledge it became possible for European scientists to explain correctly many of the mechanisms of the solar system, including the sequence of night and day.\n" +
                    "After these discoveries, it was thought that the Sun was stationary and did not rotate about its axis like the Earth. I remember having studied this fallacy from Geography books during my school days.\n" +
                    "Consider the following Qur’anic verse:\n" +
                    "وَهُوَ الَّذِي خَلَقَ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ ۖ كُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ\n" +
                    "\"it is he Who created the Night and the Day, and the Sun and the Moon: All (the celestial bodies) swim along, each inits rounded course.\" [ 21:33 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word used in  the above verse is yasbahoon . This word is derived from the word sabaha . I t carries with i t the idea of motion that comes from any moving body. If you use this word for a person on the ground, it would not  mean that he is rolling but would imply that he is walking or\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "running. If you use this word for  a  person in water, i t would not mean that he is floating but would imply that he is swimming.\n" +
                    "Similarly, if you use the word yasbah for a celestial body such as the sun, it would not only mean that it is flying through space but would also mean  that it is rotating as i t goes through space. Most school textbooks have now incorporated the fact that the sun rotates about its axis. The rotation of the sun about its own axis can be proved with the help of an equipment that project s the image of the sun on the top of a table, so that one can examine the image of the sun without being blinded. It is noticed that the sun has spots which complete a circular motion once every 25 days i.e. the sun takes approximately 25 days to rotate round its axis.\n" +
                    "The sun travels through space at roughly 240 km per second, and takes about 200 million years to complete one revolution around the centre of our Milky Way Galaxy\n" +
                    "لَا الشَّمْسُ يَنْبَغِي لَهَا أَنْ تُدْرِكَ الْقَمَرَ وَلَا اللَّيْلُ سَابِقُ النَّهَارِ ۚ وَكُلٌّ فِي فَلَكٍ يَسْبَحُونَ\n" +
                    "\"it is not permitted to the sun to catch up the moon, norcan the Night out strip the Day: Each (just) swims along in (its own) orbit (according to Law)\" [ 36:40 ]\n" +
                    "This verse mentions an essential fact discovered\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "only   recently  by   modern\tastronomy, i.e. the existence of the individual orbits of the Sun and the Moon, and their journey through space with their own motion.\n" +
                    "The ‘fixed place’ towards which the sun travels, carrying with it the solar system, has been located preirsely by modern astronomy. It has been given a name, the Solar Apex. The solar system is indeed moving in space towards a point situated in the con stellation of Hercules (alpha Lyrae) whose exact location is now firmly established.\n" +
                    "The moon rotates around i t s axis in the same duration  that it  takes to revolve  around the earth. I t takes approximately 29½ days to complete one rotation.\n" +
                    "One cannot help but be amazed at the scientific accuracy of the Qur’anic verses. Should we not ponder over the question: “What is the source of knowledge contained in the Qur’an?”\n" +
                    "THE SUN WILL EXTINGUISH\n" +
                    "The light of the sun is due to a chemical process on its surface that has been taking place continuou sly for the past five billion years. It will come to an end at some point of time in the future, when the sun will be totally extinguished, leading to extinction of all life on earth. Regarding the impermanence of the sun’s existence, the Qur’an says:\n" +
                    "وَالشَّمْسُ تَجْرِي لِمُسْتَقَرٍّ لَهَا ۚ ذَٰلِكَ تَقْدِيرُ الْعَزِيزِ الْعَلِيمِ\n" +
                    "\"And the Sun runs its course for a period determined for it; that is the decree of (Him) the exalted in Might, the All-Knowing\" [ 36:38 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word used here is m ustaqarr , which means a place or time that is determined. Thus the Qur’an says that the sun runs towards a determined place, and will do so only up to a pre-determined period of t ime – meaning that i t will end or extinguish.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "INTERSTELLAR MATTER\n" +
                    "Space outside organized astronomical systems was earlier assumed to be a vacuum. Astrophysicists later discovered the presence of bridges of matter in this interstellar space. These bridges of matter are called plasma, and con sist of com pletely ionized gas containing equal number of free electrons and positive ions. Plasma is sometimes called the fourth state of matter (besides the three known  states viz. solid, liquid and gas). The Qur’an refers  to the presence of this interstellar material in the following verse:\n" +
                    "الَّذِي خَلَقَ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضَ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا\n" +
                    "\"he Who created the heavens and the earth and all that is between\" [ 25:59 ]\n" +
                    "It would be ridiculous for anyone to even suggest that the presence of interstellar galactic material was known 1400 years ago!\n" +
                    "THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE\n" +
                    "In 1925, American astronomer Edwin Hubble, provided observational evidence that all galaxies are moving away from one another, which implies that the universe is expanding. The expansion of the universe is now an established scientific fact. This is what the Qur’an says regarding the nature of the universe:\n" +
                    "وَالسَّمَاءَ بَنَيْنَاهَا بِأَيْدٍ وَإِنَّا لَمُوسِعُونَ\n" +
                    "\"With power and skill did We construct the Firmament: For it is We Who create the vastness of Space\" [ 51:57 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word musioon is correctly translated as ‘expanding i t’, and i t refers to the creation of the expanding vastness of the universe.\n" +
                    "One of the greatest astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, in his book, ‘A Brief History of Time’,\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "says, “The discovery that the universe is expanding was one of the great intellectual revolutions of the 20th century.” The Qur’an mentioned the expansion of the universe, before man even learnt to build a telescope!\n" +
                    "Some may say that the presence of astronomical facts in the Qur’an is not surprising since the Arabs were advanced in the field of astronomy. They are correct in acknowledging the advancement of the Arabs in the field of astronomy. However they fail to realize that the Qur’an was revealed centuries before the Arabs excelled in astronomy. Moreover many of the scientific facts mentioned above, such as the origin of the universe with a Big Bang, were not known to the Arabs even at the peak of their scientific\tadvancement.\tThe\tscientific\tfacts mentioned in the Qur’an are therefore not due to the Arabs’ advancement in astronomy. Indeed, the reverse is true: they advanced in  astronomy, because astronomy occu pies a place in the Qur’an.\n",
            "ATOMS CAN BE DIVIDED\n" +
                    "In ancient times a well-known  theory by  the name of ‘Theory of Atomism’ was widely accepted. This theory was originally proposed by the Greeks, in particular by a scholar called Democritu s, who lived about 23 centuries ago. Democritus and the people that came after him, assumed that  the smallest unit of matter was the atom. The ancient Arabs used to believe the same. The Arabic word zarrah most commonly meant an atom. In recent times modern science has discovered that i t is possible to split even  an  atom. That  the atom can be  split further is a development of the 20 th century. Fourteen centuries ago this concept would have appeared unusual even to an Arab. For him the zarrah  was the limit beyond which one could not go. The following Qur’anic verse however, refuses to acknowledge this limit:\n" +
                    "وَقَالَ الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا لَا تَأْتِينَا السَّاعَةُ ۖ قُلْ بَلَىٰ وَرَبِّي لَتَأْتِيَنَّكُمْ عَالِمِ الْغَيْبِ ۖ لَا يَعْزُبُ عَنْهُ مِثْقَالُ ذَرَّةٍ فِي السَّمَاوَاتِ وَلَا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَا أَصْغَرُ مِنْ ذَٰلِكَ وَلَا أَكْبَرُ إِلَّا فِي كِتَابٍ مُبِينٍ\n" +
                    "\"The Unbelievers say, Never to us will come the Hour: say, Nay! but mostsurely, by my lord it will come upon you by Him Who knows the unseen from Whom is not hidden the least little atom in the Heavens or no earth: nor is there anything less than that or greater, but is in the record perpicuous.\" [ 34:3 ]\n" +
                    "This verse also refers to the Omniscience of God, His knowledge of all things, hidden or apparent. It then goes further and says that God is aware of everything, including what is smaller or bigger than the atom. Thus the verse clearly shows that i t is possible for something smaller than the atom to exist, a fact discovered only recently by modern science",
            "THE WATER CYCLE\n" +
                    "In 1580, Bernard Palissy was the fir s t person to describe the present day concept of ‘water cycle’. He described how water evaporates from the oceans and cools to form clouds. The clouds move inland where they r ise, condense and fall as rain. This water gathers as lakes and streams and flows back  to the ocean in a continuous cycle. In the 7th century B.C., Thales of Miletus believed that  surface spray of the ocean s was picked up by the wind and carried inland to fall as rain.\n" +
                    "In earlier  times people did\tnot know the source of underground water. They thought the water of the oceans, under the effect of winds, was thrust towards the interior of the continents. They also believed that the water returned by a secret passage or the Great Abyss. This passage is connected to the ocean s and has been called the ‘Tartarus’, since Plato’s t ime. Even Descartes, a great thinker of the eighteenth century, subscribed to this view. Till the nineteenth century, Aristotle’s theory was s till  prevalent. According to this theory, water was condensed in cool mountain caverns and formed underground lakes that fed springs. Today, we have come to know that the rainwater that seeps into the cracks of the ground is responsible for this.\n" +
                    "This is described by the Qur’an in the following verses:\n" +
                    "أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ أَنْزَلَ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَسَلَكَهُ يَنَابِيعَ فِي الْأَرْضِ ثُمَّ يُخْرِجُ بِهِ زَرْعًا مُخْتَلِفًا أَلْوَانُهُ\n" +
                    "\"Seest thou not that Allah sends down rain from the sky, and leads it through springs in the earth\" [ 39:21 ]" +
                    "وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً فَيُحْيِي بِهِ الْأَرْضَ بَعْدَ مَوْتِهَا ۚ إِنَّ فِي ذَٰلِكَ لَآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ\n" +

                    "وَأَنْزَلْنَا مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مَاءً بِقَدَرٍ فَأَسْكَنَّاهُ فِي الْأَرْضِ ۖ وَإِنَّا عَلَىٰ ذَهَابٍ بِهِ لَقَادِرُونَ\n" +

                    "The Arabic word used here is lawaaqih which is the plural of laqih  from  laqaha ,  which  means to impregnate or fecundate. In this context, impregnate means that the wind pushes the clouds together increasing the condensation that causes lightning and thus rain. A similar description is foun d in the following verses of the Qur’an:\n" +
                    "أَلَمْ تَرَ أَنَّ اللَّهَ يُزْجِي سَحَابًا ثُمَّ يُؤَلِّفُ بَيْنَهُ ثُمَّ يَجْعَلُهُ رُكَامًا فَتَرَى الْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَالِهِ وَيُنَزِّلُ مِنَ السَّمَاءِ مِنْ جِبَالٍ فِيهَا مِنْ بَرَدٍ فَيُصِيبُ بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ وَيَصْرِفُهُ عَنْ مَنْ يَشَاءُ ۖ يَكَادُ سَنَا بَرْقِهِ يَذْهَبُ بِالْأَبْصَارِ\n" +

And He sends down from the sky mountain masses (of clouds) wherein is hail: He strikes therewith whom He pleases and He turns it away from whom He pleases the vivid flash of His lightning well-nigh blinds the sight\" [ 24:43 ]\n" +
                    "اللَّهُ الَّذِي يُرْسِلُ الرِّيَاحَ فَتُثِيرُ سَحَابًا فَيَبْسُطُهُ فِي السَّمَاءِ كَيْفَ يَشَاءُ وَيَجْعَلُهُ كِسَفًا فَتَرَى الْوَدْقَ يَخْرُجُ مِنْ خِلَالِهِ ۖ فَإِذَا أَصَابَ بِهِ مَنْ يَشَاءُ مِنْ عِبَادِهِ إِذَا هُمْ يَسْتَبْشِرُونَ\n" +

                    "Modern data on Hydrology agrees perfectly with the Qur'anic description on the same subject.\n" +
                    "The water cycle is described in several other verses of the Glorious Qur’an, including 7:57, 13:17, 25:48- 49, 35:9, 36:34, 45:5, 50:9-11, 56:68-70 and 67:30\n",

                    "In geology, the phenomenon of ‘folding’, is a recently discovered fact. Folding is responsible for the formation of mountain ranges. The earth’s crust, on which we live, is like a solid shell, while the deeper layers are hot and fluid, and thus inhospitable to any form of life. I t is also known  that  the stability of the mountains is linked to the phenomenon of folding, for i t was the folds that were to provide foundations for the reliefs that constitute the mountains.\n" +
                    "Geologists tell us that the radius of the Earth is about 6,035 km and the crust on which we live is very thin, ranging between 2 to 35 km. Since the crust is thin, i t has a high possibility of shaking. Mountains act like stakes or tent pegs that hold the earth’s crust and give i t stability. The Qur’an contain s exactly such a description:\n" +

                    "A book entitled ‘Earth’ is regarded as a basic reference textbook on geology in many universities around the world. One of the authors of this book is Dr. Frank Press, who was the President of the Academy of Sciences in the USA for 12 years and was the Science Advisor  to former  US  President J immy Carter. In this book, he illu strates the mountain in a wedge-shape and the mountain itself as a small part of the whole, whose root is deeply entrenched in the ground. 1 Accor ding to Dr. Press, the mountains play an important role in stabilizing the crust of the earth.\n" +
                    "The Qur’an clearly mentions the function of the mountains in preventing the earth from shaking:\n" +

                    "Mountain formations occur at the boundary of the plates. The earth’s crust is 5 km thick below ocean s, about 35 km thick below flat continental surfaces and almost 80 km thick below great mountain ranges.

                    "In  the  Arabic  text  the  word  barzakh\tmeans a barrier or a partition. This barrier, however, is not a physical partition. The Arabic word maraja literally means ‘they both meet and mix with each other’. Early commentators of the Qur’an were unable to explain the two opposite meanings for the two bodies of water, i.e. they meet and mix, and at the same time there is a barrier between them. Modern Science has discovered that in the places where two different seas meet, there is a barrier between them. This barrier divides the two seas so that each sea has its own temperature, salinity and density. 1 Oceanologists are now in a better position to explain this verse. There is a slanted unseen water barrier between the two seas through which water from one sea passes to the other.\n" +

                    "But when the Qur’an speaks about the divider between fresh and salt water, i t mentions the existence of “a forbidding partition” with the barrier.\n" +

                    "Modern science has discovered that in estuaries, where fresh (sweet) and salt water meet, the situation is somewhat different from that found in places where two salt water seas meet. It has been discovered that what distinguishes fresh water from salt water in estuaries is a “pycnocline zone with a marked density discontinuity separating the two layers.”1 This partition (zone of separation) has a salinity different from both the fresh water and the salt water.2\n" +

For any to whom Allah giveth not light, there is no light\" [ 24:40 ]\n" +
                    "Prof. Rao said that scientists have only now been able to confirm, with the help of modern equipment, that there is darkness in the depths of the ocean. Humans are unable to dive unaided underwater for more than 20 to 30 metres, and cannot survive in the deep oceanic regions at a depth of more than 200 metres. This verse does not refer to all seas because not every sea can be described as having accumulated darkness layered one over another. It refers especially to a deep sea or deep ocean, as the Qur’an says, “darkness in a vast deep ocean”. This layered darkness in a deep ocean is the result of two causes:\n" +
                    "1.\tA light ray is composed of seven colours seen in the rainbow. These seven colours are Violet,\n" +
                    "Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange and Red (VIBGYOR). The light ray undergoes refraction when it hits water. The upper 10 to 15 metres of water absorb the red colour. Therefore, if a diver is 25 metres under water and gets wounded, he would not be able to see the red colour of his blood, because the red colour does not reach this depth. Similarly, orange rays are absorbed at 30 to 50 metres, yellow at 50 to 100 metres, green at 100 to 200 metres, and finally, blue beyond 200 metres and violet and indigo above 200 metres. Due to successive disappearance of colour, one layer after another, the ocean progressively becomes darker, i.e. darkness takes place in layers of light. Below a depth of 1000 meters there is com plete darkness.\n" +
                    "2.\tThe sun’s rays are absorbed by clouds which in turn scatter light rays thus causing a layer of darkness under the clouds. This is the fir s t layer of darkness. When light rays reach the surface of the ocean they are reflected by the wave surface giving i t a shiny appearance. Therefore, it is the waves which reflect light and cause darkness. The unreflected light penetrates into the depths of the ocean. Thus, the\tocean\thas\ttwo\tparts.\tThe\tsurface characterized by light and warmth and the depth characterized by darkness. The surface 1 Oceans, Elder and Pernetta, p. 27.\n" +
                    "is further separated from the deep part of the ocean by waves.\n" +
                    "The internal waves cover the deep waters of seas and ocean s because the deep waters have a higher density than the waters above them.\n" +
                    "The darkness begins below the internal waves. Even the fish in the depths of the ocean cannot see; their only source of light is from their own bodies.\n" +
                    "The Qur’an describes this aptly:\n" +

                    "أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا إِلَى الطَّيْرِ فَوْقَهُمْ صَافَّاتٍ وَيَقْبِضْنَ ۚ مَا يُمْسِكُهُنَّ إِلَّا الرَّحْمَٰنُ ۚ إِنَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَيْءٍ بَصِيرٌ\n" +
                    "\"Do they not observe the birds above them, spreading their wings and folding them in? None can uphold them except(Allah) Most Grecious: truly it is He that wathces over all things\" [ 67:19 ]\n" +
                    "The Arabic word a msaka li terally means, ‘to put one’s hand on, seize, hold, hold someone back,’ which expresses the idea that Allah  holds  the bird up in His power. These verses stress the extremely close dependence of the birds’ behaviour on Divine law. Modern scientific data has shown the degree of perfection attained by certain species of birds with regard to the programming of their movements. It is only the existence of a migratory programme in the genetic code of the birds that can explain the long and complicated journey that very young birds, without any prior experience and without any guide, are able to accom plish. They are also able to return to the departure point on a definite date.\n" +
                    "Prof. Hamburger in his book ‘Power and Fragility’ gives the example of ‘mutton-bird’ that lives in the Pacific with i t s journey of over 24,000 km in the shape of figure ‘8’. It makes this journey over a\n" +
                    "period of 6 months and comes back to its departure point with a maximum delay of one week. The highly com plicated instructions for such a journey have to be contained in the birds’ nervous cells. They are definitely programmed. Therefore, should we not at least reflect on the identity of this ‘Programmer’?\n" +

                    "وَأَوْحَىٰ رَبُّكَ إِلَى النَّحْلِ أَنِ اتَّخِذِي مِنَ الْجِبَالِ بُيُوتًا وَمِنَ الشَّجَرِ وَمِمَّا يَعْرِشُونَ\n" +
                    "\"And thy Lord taught the Bee to build its cells in hills, on trees, and in (men's) habitations\"\n" +
                    "ثُمَّ كُلِي مِنْ كُلِّ الثَّمَرَاتِ فَاسْلُكِي سُبُلَ رَبِّكِ ذُلُلًا ۚ \n" +
                    "\"then to eat of all the produce ( of the earth ), and find with skills the specious path of its Lord\" [ 16:68-69 ]\n" +
                    "Von-Frisch received the Nobel Prize in 1973 for his research on the behaviour and communication of the bees. The bee, after discovering any new garden or flower, goes back and tells its fellow bees the exact direction and map to get there, which is known as ‘bee dance’. The meanings of this insect’s movements that are intended to transmit information between worker bees have been discovered scientifically using photography and other methods. The Qur’an mentions in the above verses how the bee with its skill, finds the spacious paths of its Lord.\n" +
                    "The gender used for the bee in the above verses is the female gender ( fa’slukî and kulî ), indicating that the bee that leaves its home for gathering food is a female bee. In other words the soldier or worker bee is a female bee.\n" +
                    "In fact, in Shakespeare’s play, ‘Henry the Fourth’, some of the characters speak about bees and mention that the bees are soldiers and that they have a king. That is what people thought in Shakespearean t imes. They thought that the worker bees are male bees and they go home and are answerable to a king bee. This, however, is not true. The worker bees are females and they do not report to a king bee but to a queen bee. But it took modern investigations in the last 300 years to discover this.\n" +

                    "\"The paraable of those who take protectors other than Allah, is that of the spider who builds (to itself) a house; but truly the flimsiest of houses is the spider;s house if they but knew\" [ 29:41 ]\n" +
                    "Besides giving the physical description of the spider’s web as being very flimsy, delicate and weak, the Qur’an also stresses on the flimsiness of the relationship in the spider’s house, where the female spider many a times kills its mate, the male spider.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "The parable also has reference to the weakness of such relationship of the people who seek protection for this world and for the hereafter from those other than Allah\n" +

                    "\"And before Solomon were marshalled his, hosts of jinns and mend and birds, and they were all kept in order and ranks\"\n" +
                    "حَتَّىٰ إِذَا أَتَوْا عَلَىٰ وَادِ النَّمْلِ قَالَتْ نَمْلَةٌ يَا أَيُّهَا النَّمْلُ ادْخُلُوا مَسَاكِنَكُمْ لَا يَحْطِمَنَّكُمْ سُلَيْمَانُ وَجُنُودُهُ وَهُمْ لَا يَشْعُرُونَ\n" +
                    "\"At length, when they came to a (lowly) valley of ants, one of the ants said : O ye ants, get into your habitations, lest Solomon and his hosts crush you (under foot) without knowing it\" [ 27:17-18 ]\n" +
                    "In the past, some people would have probably mocked at the Qur’an, taking it to be a book of fairy tales  in\twhich\tants\ttalk\tto  each  other\tand communicate sophisticated messages. In recent times however, research has shown us several facts about the lifestyle of ants, which were not known earlier to humankind. Research has shown that the animals or insects whose lifestyle is closest in resemblance to the lifestyle of human beings are the ants. This can be seen from the following findings regarding ants:\n" +
                    "(a)\tThe ants bury their dead in a manner similar to the humans.\n" +
                    "(b)\tThey have a sophisticated system of division of labour, whereby they have managers, supervisors, foremen, workers, etc.\n" +
                    "(c)\tOnce in a while they meet among themselves to have a ‘chat’.\n" +
                    "(d)\tThey have an advanced method of communication among themselves.\n" +
                    "(e)\tThey hold regular ‘markets’ where they exchange goods.\n" +
                    "(f)\tThey store grain for long periods in winter and if the grain begins to bud, they cut the roots, as if they understand that if they leave it to grow, it will rot. If the grain stored by them gets wet due to rains, they take it out into the sunlight to dry, and once dry, they take it back inside as though they know that humidity will cause development of root systems which will cause the grain to rot.\n",
            "HONEY: HEALING FOR HUMANKIND\n" +
                    "The bee assimilates juices of various kinds of flowers and fruit and forms honey within its body, which it stores in its cells of wax. Only a couple of centuries ago humans came to know that honey comes from the belly of the bee. But this fact was mentioned in the Qur’an 1,400 years ago in the following verse:\n" +
                    "يَخْرُجُ مِنْ بُطُونِهَا شَرَابٌ مُخْتَلِفٌ أَلْوَانُهُ فِيهِ شِفَاءٌ لِلنَّاسِ ۗ \n" +
                    "\"There issues from within their bodies a drink of varying colours wherein is healing for men\" [ 16:69 ]\n" +
                    "We are only now aware that honey has healing properties and is also a mild antiseptic. The Russians would use honey to cover their wounds in World War II. The wound would retain moisture and would leave very little scar tissue. Due to the density of honey, no fungus or bacteria could grow in the wound.\n" +
                    "Dramatic improvements were visible in 22 incurable chest and Alzheimer's disease patients at nursing Homes in England who were treated by Sister Carole, a nun, with propolis, a substance which bees produce to seal hives against bacteria. A person suffering from an allergy of a particular plant may be given honey from that plant so that  the person develops resistance to that allergy. Honey is also rich in fructose and vitamin K.\n" +
                    "The knowledge contained in the Qur’an regarding honey, i t s origin and properties, was discovered centuries after its revelation.\n",
            "BLOOD CIRCULATION AND MILK\n" +
                    "The Qur’an was revealed 600 years before the Muslim\tscientist\tIbn\tNafees\tdescribed\tthe circulation of the blood and 1,000 years before William Harwey brought this understanding to the Western world. Roughly thirteen centuries before it was known what happens in the intestines to ensure that organs are nourished by the process of digestive absorption, a verse in the Qur’an described the source of the con stituents of milk, in conformity with these notions.\n" +
                    "To understand the Qur’anic verse concerning the above concepts, i t is important to know  that chemical reactions occur in the intestines and that, from there, substances extracted from food pass into the blood stream via a complex system; sometimes by way of the liver, depending on their chemical nature. The blood transports them  to all the organs of the body, among which are the milk-producing mammary glands.\n" +
                    "In simple terms, certain substances from the contents of the intestines enter into the vessels of the intestinal wall itself, and these substances are transported by the blood stream to the various organs.\n" +
                    " \n" +
                    "This physiological concept must be fully appreciated if we wish to understand the following verses of the Qur’an:\n" +
                    "وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي الْأَنْعَامِ لَعِبْرَةً ۖ نُسْقِيكُمْ مِمَّا فِي بُطُونِهِ مِنْ بَيْنِ فَرْثٍ وَدَمٍ لَبَنًا خَالِصًا سَائِغًا لِلشَّارِبِينَ\n" +
                    "\"And verifly in cattle there is a lesson for you We give you to drink of what is inside their bodies, coming from conjuction between the contents of the intestine and blood, a milk pure and pleasant for those who drink it.\" [ 16:66 ]\n" +
                    "وَإِنَّ لَكُمْ فِي الْأَنْعَامِ لَعِبْرَةً ۖ نُسْقِيكُمْ مِمَّا فِي بُطُونِهَا وَلَكُمْ فِيهَا مَنَافِعُ كَثِيرَةٌ وَمِنْهَا تَأْكُلُونَ\n" +
                    "\"And in cattle (too) ye have an instuctive example: from within their bodies We produce (milk) for you to drink; there are, in them, (besides), numerous (other) benefits for you and of their(meats) ye eat\" [ 23:21 ]\n" +
                    "The 1400 year old Qur’anic  description of the production of milk in cattle is strikingly similar to what modern physiology has discovered in recent times",
